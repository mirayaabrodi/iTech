# iTech :infinity:

A website about a industry called iTech , which show-cases their work and their blog posts. :tada:

## The Background Behind This Project :open_book:

This project was mainly focused on strengthening my skills on Animations, Transitions and Transforms. I wanted the website to also be very protruding and look very much like 3D, so I use a lot of `box-shadow`. The color theme is purple. :blush:

## What I learned :brain:

- Heavily focused on the `animation`, `transition` and `transform`
- To combine colors and images so they fit well together
- To creat box-shadow around my images
